Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks,\n\n## Context #2\ne 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L\n\n## Context #3\ng BERT\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ?pair in text classiﬁcation\no\n\n## Context #4\nm one or more layers without ﬁne-tuning\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\nthe classiﬁcation layer.\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERT LARGE\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art meth-\nods. The best performing method concatenates the\ntoken representations from the top four hidden lay-\ners of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\n0.3 F1 behind ﬁne-tuning the entire model. This\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both ﬁne-\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\n6 Conclusion\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\npart of many language understanding systems. In\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\nizing these ﬁndings to deep bidirectional architec-\ntures, allowing the same p\n\n## Context #5\nE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for the H= 768 and 4096 for the H= 1024 .\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-Input/Output Representations To make BERT\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\n(e.g.,hQuestion, Answeri) in one token sequence.\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\nlinguistic sentence.
